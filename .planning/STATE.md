## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Multi-mode architecture (Phase 1) before features to avoid retrofitting
- [Roadmap]: DevTools as separate package (Bustand.DevTools) to prevent production bloat
- [Roadmap]: Persistence split from Middleware phase due to JS interop complexity
- [01-01]: Simplified MODE-05 - subscribers call InvokeAsync in handlers (ComponentBase.InvokeAsync is protected)
- [01-01]: Used classic .sln format over .slnx for broader tool compatibility
- [01-02]: Used OperatingSystem.IsBrowser() for WASM detection (most reliable .NET 6+ approach)
- [01-02]: Post-process pattern for lifetime overrides (Scrutor scans first, then re-register with explicit lifetimes)
- [01-02]: Console.WriteLine for warnings (simple, no logging dependency required in Phase 1)
- [01-03]: Added InternalsVisibleTo for test access to GetRegisteredLifetime helper
- [01-03]: Used BunitContext instead of deprecated TestContext for component testing
